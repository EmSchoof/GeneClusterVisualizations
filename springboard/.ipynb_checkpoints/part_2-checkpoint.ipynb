    "- If profits decreased after the experiment, it would mean that reimbursement of toll fees may not have been the most effective way to encourage drivers to be active in both cities in order to increase profits. If profits stay the same, then the feature should be left intact due to the possible convenience to some drivers and potential increase in profits as time goes on. Finally, if profits increase, it could mean that more experiments relating reimbursements, such as gas or mileage, should be explored in order to further increase profits."
